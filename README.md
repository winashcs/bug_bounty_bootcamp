Networking basics : <br>
Network : is a connection of multiple network devices via any medium.<br>
Networking : is communication or transmisson of data between devices.<br>
Internetworking : is connecting more than two networks. Example : youtube videos connect many people as you can keep sharing videos. <br>
Need of networking : we can share resources over LAN or WAN, we can connect laptops with printer for printouts, most importantly we can share data.<br>
Point-to-Point (P2P) model : in this model only two devices are connected to each other.<br>
Client-Server model : clients request services or resources from servers which fulfill their requests.<br>
Computer network : is a system of interconnected computers that use a set of common communication protocols for the purpose of sharing resources.<br>
Types of computer network : Personal Area Netwok (PAN) : in bluetooth. Local Area Network (LAN) : in homes,small office. Campus Area Network (CAN) : connecting two or more LANs in university campuses (small geographical area). Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) : connection of two or more LANs in big campuses (large geographical area). Wide Area Network (WAN) : geographical communication in internet.<br>
Topology : arrangement of networking devices over a network.<br>
Bus Topology : all devices are connected to a single back bone cable. One device failure creates problem in entire network.<br>
Star Topology : all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Hub or switch fails creates problem in entire network.<br>
Tree Topology : combination of star and bus topology.<br>
Mesh Topology : each device is connected to every other device.<br>
Hybrid Topology : collection of two or more topology.<br>
Ring Topology : connects device in circular manner where each device is connected to two other devices on either side in a closed loop. Data transfer happens in clock-wise format.<br>
Dual Ring Topology : connects devices with help of two rings where data transfer happens in clock-wise as well as anti-clock-wise.<br>
OSI MODEL :
