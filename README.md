NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS : <br>
Network : is a connection of multiple network devices via any medium.<br>
Networking : is communication or transmisson of data between devices.<br>
Internetworking : is connecting more than two networks. Example : youtube videos connect many people as you can keep sharing videos. <br>
Need of networking : we can share resources over LAN or WAN, we can connect laptops with printer for printouts, most importantly we can share data.<br>
Point-to-Point (P2P) model : in this model only two devices are connected to each other.<br>
Client-Server model : clients request services or resources from servers which fulfill their requests.<br>
Computer network : is a system of interconnected computers that use a set of common communication protocols for the purpose of sharing resources.<br>
Types of computer network : Personal Area Netwok (PAN) : in bluetooth. Local Area Network (LAN) : in homes,small office. Campus Area Network (CAN) : connecting two or more LANs in university campuses (small geographical area). Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) : connection of two or more LANs in big campuses (large geographical area). Wide Area Network (WAN) : geographical communication in internet.<br>
Topology : arrangement of networking devices over a network.<br>
Bus Topology : all devices are connected to a single back bone cable. One device failure creates problem in entire network.<br>
Star Topology : all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Hub or switch fails creates problem in entire network.<br>
Tree Topology : combination of star and bus topology.<br>
Mesh Topology : each device is connected to every other device.<br>
Hybrid Topology : collection of two or more topology.<br>
Ring Topology : connects device in circular manner where each device is connected to two other devices on either side in a closed loop. Data transfer happens in clock-wise format.<br>
Dual Ring Topology : connects devices with help of two rings where data transfer happens in clock-wise as well as anti-clock-wise.<br>
Switch : is a device that connects multiple devices in a network. It transmits data to only required devices. <br>
Hub : is a device that connects multiple devices in a network. It transmits data to all the connected devices. <br>
Server : is heart of the network that stores and shares information with other computers, they send the information and handle the requests.<br>
Ping : is used to test the reachability of a device. It sends a packet of data to the destination IP address and waits for the response. <br>
Data : information that is transmitted over a network. <br>
Packet/Frame : data is broken down into smaller units with additional information like destination and source address etc so that data reaches its destination accurately. It is called as packet in Network Layer but frame in Data Link Layer. <br>
OSI (Open System Interconnection) model : consists of 7 layers which works towards transfer of data from one network to another network across the globe between sender and receiver. It is developed by ISO (International Organization for Standerization). <br>
Lower Layer : Physical, Data-link, Network, Transport. They are used to send the packet. <br>
Upper Layer : Session, Presentation, Application. They are used to create the packet. <br>
(7)Application Layer : It is used to create services for interface. Example : HTTP, FTP. <br>
(6)Presentation Layer : Designs format of data like encode/decode, encrypt/decrypt, compresses/decompresses. <br>
(5)Session Layer : It establishes, maintains and terminates a connection between applications. <br>
(4)Transport Layer : Divides data into segments. Provides reliable or connectionless delivery using protocols like Trasmission Control Protocol or User Datagram Protocol between sender and receiver. <br>
(3)Network Layer : It decides the best path for data packets to travel.<br>
(2)Data Link Layer : It makes the data error free, maintains the same speed of data transfer between sender and receiver. Data is the form of frames. <br>
(1)Physical Layer : It makes the data in the form of 0 or 1 (bits). It decided to send the data to receiver in wire or wireless mode. <br>
Bandwidth : amount of data that can be transmitted within a time period. <br>
Wired media : uses wire for data transmission. <br>
Wireless media : uses electromagnetic waves for data transmission. <br>
Types of Wired media : Twisted Pair has two types Unshielded (less secure) and Shielded (more secure as there is a foil to protect data). Lan cable or ethernet cable which are used to connect devices within Local Area Network are made from Twisted Pair and have RJ 45 connector (made of 8 pins which help for data transmission). Fibre Optic Cable uses light source to send and recieve data signals it is fast and most secure among all as it is made of glass core plate and breaking it will not allow data transfer hence difficult to hack. Coaxial Cable has higher bandwidth compared to Twisted Pair and cost-effective and easy to install compared to Fiber Optic Cable. <br>
Cross cable : Used to connect similar devices. Straight cable/Patch cable : Used to connect dissimilar devices. <br>
ISP (Internet Service Provider) Network : is the one which delivers internet connectivity. Wired is fast and secure compared to wireless. <br>
Rack Technology : is technology used to organize networking devices like servers so it becomes easier for maintenance in data centres and server rooms. <br>
NIC : Network Interface Card also called as network adapter card which helps to connect to the network. It is used to perform all network related functions. <br>
MAC Address : Media Access Control is 48 bit or 12 digit (hexadecimal). It is permanent address given to each device, cannot change. It is inside the NIC. It is used to communicate within the local network. <br>
IP Address : Internet Protocol is unique address that identifies a device on the internet. Static IP Addressing : manual IP assigned by Network Admin to Host, it is fixed. Dynamic IP Addressing : it is temporary, assigned from the pool of available addresses by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). <br>
IP Version : IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) is 32 bit, represent it using decimal number and is used for small network. IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) is 128 bit, represent it using hexadecimal number and is used for large network. <br>
DNS : Domain Name System DNS is essential because it allows us to use easy-to-remember domain names (like "google.com") instead of having to remember the numerical IP addresses (such as "172.217.3.78" for Google) for every website we want to visit. It converts domain name to ip address. It can also convert back.
